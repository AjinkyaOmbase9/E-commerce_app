This is a simple e-commerce application built with React.js 
where users can browse products, search for items, filter them
by category, and mark them as favorites. The favorite products
 are stored in localStorage, so they persist even after a page
  refresh.
First I have created two files like components and pages,
In components we created three files like Header, ProductCard and ProductList,
In Pages we created two files like favourites and HomePage.
In this all pages I have implemented specific logic with naming wise.
In favorite pages we added logic like when we clicking on favorite
then it will get in favorite page.
*Product Grid View: Display a list of products in a grid layout.
*Search Bar: Filter products by name dynamically.
*Category Filter: Filter products by category.
*Favorites: Users can add products to favorites, and these are stored in localStorage.
*Favorites Page: A separate page to view and remove favorited products.
